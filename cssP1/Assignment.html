    <!-- Poem -->

    <p>
      I met a traveller from an antique land, <br />
      who said-"Two cast and trunkless legs of stone <br />
      Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand, <br />
      Hlaf sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown, <br />
      And wrinklede lip, and sneer of cold command, <br />
      Tell that its scupltor well those passions read <br />
      Which yet survive, stamped on these lifelss things, <br />
      The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed; <br />
      And on the pedestal, these words appear: <br />
      My name is <span>Ozymandias</span>, King of Kings; <br />
      Look on my Worksm ye Mighty, and despair! <br />
      Nothing beside remains. Round the decay <br />
      of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare <br />
      The lone and level sands stretch far away. "
